A visualizer designed to generate sheet music based on recorded audio.

## Input Data

The input sound files are expected to be in /Data/Audio/ folders in the root directory.
If there are no /Data/Audio/ folders, create them. Or run once, and they will be created.

## Main
Takes in input audio from Data/Audio and creates Audio() classes for each file to be processed into MIDI files.

Also where threshold/processing parameters are set.
